<p>We&#39;ve looked at historical news data to learn about the flu, but how do we keep up with news that&#39;s happening in real time?  We need a solution that can search for news about the flu in a <em>stream</em> of data.</p>
<p>In this exercise, we&#39;re going to do exactly that.  We&#39;ll build an end-to-end stream processing system which reads from the <a href="http://www.reuters.com">Reuters</a> news wire, looks for information about the flu, and saves any it finds.  This will involve a number of our Big Data tools.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we&#39;ll look at how to collect RSS data in python.  This will be the source of our news stream.</li>
<li>Second, we&#39;ll connect the python code to <a href="http://flume.apache.org/">Apache Flume</a>.  Flume is a powerful, distributed data transfer system which is simple to set up.</li>
<li>Third, we&#39;ll use <a href="http://spark.apache.org/streaming/">Spark Streaming</a> to build a Spark application which can process incoming data in real time.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find the complete source for this example in the repository under <code>flu_news/news_streaming</code></p>

<p>Flu news could come from a number of different wires, so we&#39;ll have to check many of them.  Let&#39;s consider the feeds for top news, health, healthcare, and science.</p>
<p>For each of these feeds, we need to keep track of <code>etags</code>.  E-Tag data ensures that we don&#39;t retrieve data from the news feed when there&#39;s no new news -- think of it as a &quot;high-water mark&quot; for news we&#39;ve seen.</p>

<ul>
<li>A source, which picks up data</li>
<li>A channel, which holds data until delivery</li>
<li>And a sink, which delivers data to a receiver -- this could be a file, a streaming agent, or another Flume agent.</li>

<p>In this configuration, our source is an <code>exec</code> source.  It runs a program for us and collects the output.</p>
<p>The channel is a simple memory buffer.  It can hold on to a limited number of events (or messages).  Once it&#39;s full, it will not accept any new data until its emptied by a sink.</p>
<p>The sink is an <code>avro</code> sink.  It uses the <a href="http://avro.apache.org/">Avro</a> data format to push output serialized data to any service listening for data on the specified host and port (in our case <code>localhost</code> and <code>44444</code>).</p>
<p>Finally, we connect the source and the sink together through the channel.  The source and sink both have channel parameters -- if they&#39;re set to the same channel, they&#39;re connected.</p>
<p>Once configured, we need a way to start our flume agent.  There&#39;s a script in <code>flu_news/news_streaming/start_flume.sh</code> which does this, but what it&#39;s really doing is running a flume command with our config script.</p>

<p>Now that we have a data stream ready to process, we need to build a Spark Streaming application to process that data.  Our aim is simple: process the JSON records, keep track of how many articles we&#39;ve seen, and write any articles about the flu to disk for later use.</p>
<p>This all happens in our scala code, so let&#39;s look at the <code>NewsStreamer.scala</code> class.</p>
<p>First, we have a case class for our <code>RSSItem</code>s, this will make it easy to parse the JSON data using <code>json4s</code>.</p>
<p>Next, we have the <code>containsFlu</code> method.  We&#39;ll use this simple match-case funtion to filter records of interest from the data stream.</p>
<p>The <code>main</code> method contains most of the interesting code about connecting to and processing our data stream.</p>
<ul>
<li>We need a special context for streaming jobs.<br>This <code>StreamingContext</code> takes a configuration and the time each data processing batch takes.  We&#39;ll be working on a 30 second interval, but Spark can go faster.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We create a Flume stream called <code>flumeStream</code> which listens on the specified host and port for an avro data stream.
This is stream is a <code>DStreamRDD</code> and will be the primary RDD on which our program operates.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We&#39;ll use our case class and json4s to make an RDD which contains <code>RSSItem</code> objects from our JSON data.<br>This is accomplished exactly as it would be in a non-streaming application, but in this case it&#39;s applied to each batch of streaming data.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We can filter the resulting RDD <code>rssData</code> using our <code>containsFlu</code> function.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Using the <code>print</code> method, we can count up and print what&#39;s found in each 30-second batch.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>If we&#39;ve found flu data, we want to write it to HDFS.<br>Spark Streaming provides a <code>saveAsTextFile</code> method just like Spark core, but it writes files for each batch.  Since not all news is about the flu, that would mean a lot of empty files.  Instead, we want to only write to HDFS if the count of flu records in the batch is greater than zero.</p>
<p>For this, we need to use the <code>forEachRDD</code> method.  A <code>DStream</code> is actually made up of a number of RDDs, so we&#39;ll need to process each of them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Finally, we actually start our streaming program.<br>This is done by calling <code>start()</code>.  The <code>awaitTermination</code> call provides the listening function to process data on the stream until the program is terminated.</li>
</ul>

<p>Building our Spark Streaming app is slightly different from our standalone news clustering app.  In this case, we need to include a number of libraries which are not necessarily available on every node in a Spark cluster.  This means we need to provide them in our JAR file.</p>
<p>The <code>sbt</code> <em>assembly</em> plugin makes this possible.  It builds an all-encompassing JAR which includes all the libraries we need.  To add it to our project, we create a file called <code>assembly.sbt</code>.  In the file, we add the plug-in and version.</p>

<p>While this exercise didn&#39;t examine the flu in detail, we have managed to build an end-to-end data pipeline which will help us monitor news about the flu.  We&#39;ve used a lot of components in this exercise:</p>
<ul>
<li>We used <code>feedparser</code> to grab RSS feeds in python</li>
<li>We set up a Flume agent to collect RSS feeds and transmit them to Spark Streaming</li>
<li>We build a Spark Streaming agent to process RSS items, count them, and store any that have to do with the flu</li>
</ul>
<p>From here, we can do any number of things with the incoming flu data.  Try adding some of the machine learning approaches we applied to clustering the news to the streaming case.</p>
